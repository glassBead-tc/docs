# Build MCPs
Smithery supports developers building MCPs by providing [CI/CD deployments and hosting](/build/deployments).

**Benefits of hosting:**
- Smithery will show a tool playground on your server page, allowing users to discover and try your MCP online.
- Users can call your server without installing dependencies or be concerned about security.
- Smithery will rank hosted servers higher in our search results.

For developers, we provide an [SDK](https://github.com/smithery-ai/sdk/) to make it easier to deploy servers on Smithery.
