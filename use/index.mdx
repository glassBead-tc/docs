# Introduction

This guide explains how to integrate Smithery into your application (MCP Client).

**Benefits of using Smithery:**

- Access a large catalog of MCP servers through a single gateway
- No need to manage auth secrets and configurations

## Integration Approaches

At a high-level, there are two main ways to integrate Smithery with your client application:

### 1. Direct User Authentication (Simpler)

With this simpler approach, users authenticate directly with Smithery:

- When needed, your application redirects users to create their own Smithery accounts
- Smithery handles storing auth secrets and configurations for the user
- Your client only needs the user's Smithery API key to establish connections

**Benefits:**
- Simpler implementation for client developers
- Reduced security burden on your application
- Users can reuse their configurations across multiple clients

### 2. White-Label Integration

With this approach, your application authenticates with Smithery under your developer account and proxies user connections:

- Your application manages user secrets and configurations
- You authenticate with Smithery using your developer credentials
- You send user configurations with each connection request

**Benefits:**
- Fully white-labeled experience within your application
- Complete control over the user experience
- No need for users to create Smithery accounts

**Considerations:**
- More complex implementation
- Your application must securely store user secrets
- You must send configuration with each connection request
