Profiles allow you to maintain multiple configurations and authentication contexts for the same MCP server. Think of profiles like different user accounts on your computer - each profile has its own settings, credentials, and context that determine how you interact with MCP servers.

## Why Use Profiles?

Profiles solve the challenge of **context switching** when working with MCP servers. Common scenarios include:

- Accessing different workspaces in the same service (e.g., personal vs work Notion accounts)
- Using different API credentials for development vs production environments
- Connecting to the same MCP server multiple times with different settings

Instead of reconfiguring connections each time, profiles let you save and switch between contexts seamlessly.

## How Profiles Work

Each profile stores:

- **Authentication credentials**: OAuth tokens or API keys specific to that context
- **[Session configuration](/build/session-config)**: Custom settings that modify how the server behaves

For example, you might have:
- A "Personal" profile connected to your personal Notion workspace
- A "Work" profile connected to your company's Notion workspace

Once set up, you can switch between them without re-authenticating.

## Using Profiles with OAuth

When connecting to MCP servers through [Smithery's OAuth flow](/use/connect#connecting-with-oauth):

1. During authentication, you select which profile to use
2. OAuth tokens are bound to your selected profile
3. Future connections use the saved credentials automatically

This means you authenticate once per profile, and Smithery handles token management for you.

## Managing Profiles

### Create a Profile

1. Go to [Account > Profiles](https://smithery.ai/account/profiles)
2. Click "Create Profile"
3. Name it descriptively (e.g., "Work Projects", "Personal Research")

### Add Servers to Profiles

- **From a server page**: Click "Connect" and select your profile
- **From profile settings**: Use the "Add Server" search to find and add servers

## Common Use Cases

**Development Workflows**: Separate profiles for dev, staging, and production environments

**Team Collaboration**: Individual profiles with personalized configurations while sharing the same MCP servers

**Multi-Tenant Applications**: Isolate each client's data and configuration in different profiles
