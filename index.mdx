# Introduction
Smithery is a platform to help developers find and ship services designed to communicate with AI agents. All our listed services follow the [Model Context Protocols (MCP)](#model-context-protocol) specification. Our mission is to accelerate agentic AI by making agentic services accessible.

Smithery provides:

- A centralized hub for discovering MCP servers
- Hosting and distribution for MCP servers
- Standardized interfaces for tool integration and configs

## Quick Start

<CardGroup>

    Learn how to integrate Smithery MCP servers into your apps and agents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build MCP Servers" icon="anvil" href="/build">
    Create and deploy your own MCP servers to Smithery
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Install the <a href="https://smithery.ai/server/@upstash/context7-mcp" target="_blank">Context7 MCP server</a> and use this prompt:
  
  ```
  /context7 get docs for smithery/sdk
  ```

## Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLMs and external data sources and tools. It is a universal standard for connecting AI systems with the context they need, eliminating information silos and fragmented integrations.

By providing a standard way to connect AI systems with data sources, MCP simplifies the development and maintenance of agentic applications. This makes it easier to build agents like intelligent IDEs, chat interfaces and custom AI workflows.

Instead of writing custom implementations for each new data source, developers can use MCP as a single, standardized protocol. This approach not only makes systems more maintainable but also ensures better scalability as your AI applications grow and evolve.
