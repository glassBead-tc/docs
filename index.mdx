# Motivation

We're witnessing a fundamental shift in the internetâ€™s economy - one where [tool calls are becoming the new clicks](https://smithery.ai/blog/tool-calls-are-the-new-clicks).

As AI agents become more capable, they need access to AI-native services to accomplish real-world tasks. Smithery provides the infrastructure to make this possible.

## What is Smithery?

Smithery simplifies how AI agents interact with MCP servers. We provide:

- **Unified Gateway**: Connect to multiple MCP servers through a single API endpoint
- **Server Marketplace**: Discover and access 8,000+ AI-native services
- **Managed Authentication**: Single sign-on for agents with unified API key management
- **Hosting Platform**: Deploy and distribute your MCP servers with built-in infrastructure

## Why Smithery?

Building AI agents today means juggling multiple integrations, authentication methods, and service configurations. Consider a typical agent that needs to:
- Search the web with Exa
- Browse pages with Browserbase
- Access databases with various connectors
- Integrate with productivity tools

Without Smithery, each integration requires separate setup, authentication, and maintenance. Smithery consolidates this complexity into a single, consistent interface.

## Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLMs and external data sources and tools. It provides a standard way for AI systems to interact with services, eliminating fragmentation across the ecosystem.

By providing a standard way to connect AI systems with data sources, MCP simplifies the development and maintenance of agentic applications. This makes it easier to build agents like intelligent IDEs, chat interfaces and custom AI workflows.

Instead of writing custom implementations for each new data source, developers can use MCP as a single, standardized protocol. This approach not only makes systems more maintainable but also ensures better scalability as your AI applications grow and evolve.
