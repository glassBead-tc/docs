# Search Servers

The registry is a list of MCP servers that are available to use. You can search for MCP servers by name, description, tags, or profile. To get started, all you need is a Smithery API Key. You can get one at [smithery.ai/account/api-keys](https://smithery.ai/account/api-keys).

<Tip>
  To search for servers in a profile, you'll need to get the [**profile
  ID**](https://smithery.ai/account/profiles), not the profile name.
