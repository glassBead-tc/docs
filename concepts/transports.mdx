## Transports

MCP servers can be configured to use different transports. The default transport is STDIO, which is a simple, text-based protocol that is easy to implement. However, it is not the most efficient transport, and it is not the most secure transport.

The other transports are SSE and Streamable HTTP. SSE is a more efficient transport that is more secure than STDIO. Streamable HTTP is a more efficient transport that is more secure than STDIO.
