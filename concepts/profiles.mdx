# Profiles

When you connect to an MCP server through Smithery, we store your identity in a profile. This profile is then used to transport your identity between clients.

Similar to profiles on your browser, you can have a "Personal" profile with connections to Spotify, your personal Notion, etc. and a "Work" profile with connections to your work Notion, your work Slack, Linear, etc.

You can manage your profiles at [smithery.ai/account/profiles](https://smithery.ai/account/profiles).

Then, when you add a Smithery URL to a client that connects over OAuth, you can select the profile you want to use.

This will then securely transport your Smithery identity to the MCP client you are using, like Cursor or Claude Desktop.

To search for servers in a profile, check out the [page on searching servers with the registry API](/concepts/registry_search_servers).
